Texture Networks: Feed-forward Synthesis of Textures.

Training feed forward convolutional networks to learn and generate multiple textures of a style image using noise tensors of different size as input. 

Here it is done for Z=3 input noise layers, using adam optimizer to train networks parameter from texture image.
